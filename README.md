# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, thanks for stopping by!

_Tired of seeing 100% AI generated, futuristically glowing github profiles with more .gifs than reddit_? 

_Yearn for those simpler times, of basic badge links and grammatically incorrect readme's_?

Well you've come to the right place.

## Who am I? 

My name's Troy, I'm an active student at 42 Lausanne and itching to get into the field of cybersecurity.
<br>
<br>

## Since you're here, why not have a look around? Here's a couple of the more interesting project's I've done:
